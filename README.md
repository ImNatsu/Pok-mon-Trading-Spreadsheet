# Pokémon Trading Spreadsheet

A script made to display Pokémon trading information stored in Google Sheets

## Features

* Filter Pokémon by generation, gender ratio & Poké Ball
* Display breedables, valuable Pokémon (e.g., shinies or RNGs) and wants
* Faster loading than sharing a Google Sheets document

## How to Use

### Preparation

1. Create a copy of this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1djWEDpw4w0aLrurcnxkLupkzfB1Gw0_SHB8zZWY3Sts/edit?usp=sharing) (`File > Make a Copy…`).
  * Be careful not to edit the 1st row (headers) of any sheet! 
  * Name your sheets in the following format "FT:Name of my sheet" or "LF:Name of another sheet". They will be sorted by the script.
  * You may duplicate the "TEMPLATE" sheets (up to a maximum of 8 tabs).
  * Do not move or rename the "CONFIG" or "DB" sheets.
2. Fill your copy of the spreadsheet with your Pokémon.
3. Make your spreadsheet public (`File > Publish to the web…`).

See [Demo](#demo) below if you're unsure of how to fill the spreadsheet.

### Method 1: Beginner

Find the ID of your spreadsheet and paste it at the end of this link: `https://pokemon-trading-spreadsheet.tumblr.com/?spreadsheet-id`

Example: `https://pokemon-trading-spreadsheet.tumblr.com/?1P9wMb9e0YbhcOua9RQeRCJjllf_L77uV-7i4Q0Yor0o`

That's it! Share the resulting link with your potential trade partners.

### Method 2: Advanced

Use any of the following methods if you want a custom URL or want to make changes to the script/styling.

#### Method 2A: Tumblr

1. Create a new Tumblr blog and go to `Account > Edit Appearance > Edit theme > Edit HTML`.
2. Copy [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richi3f/pokemon-trading-spreadsheet/master/tumblr_theme.html) and then click `Update Preview` followed by `Save`.
3. Edit the Theme Options with your spreadsheet's ID and personal information.
4. Go to `Advanced Options` and set `Use default mobile theme` to false.

#### Method 2B: GitHub Pages

1. Clone this repository.
2. Edit `config.js` with your spreadsheet's ID and personal information.
3. Go to `Settings` and set the `Source` to `master branch` under the GitHub Pages header.

#### Method 2: How to Update

This is only for those using **Method 2**. If you're using Mehtod 1, any changes here will be reflected automatically.

If there's been an update, you will need to replace files on your end with the new ones. For Tumblr users, this means copying again the [theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richi3f/pokemon-trading-spreadsheet/master/tumblr_theme.html). Those using GitHub Pages will have to download the files I have edited and upload them to their repository.
